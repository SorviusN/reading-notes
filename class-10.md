## How to find errors in code

### Order of execution
- Important to understand the order in which programs are run from, not necessarily the top-bottom of your code.

### Execution Contexts
- Global context
- Function context
- Eval Context

- Variable scope
  - first two execution contexts corresponed with the notion of scope.

### The stack
- JS interpreter processes on e line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another func, it stack and piles function on top of task.


### Execution context and hoisting
- Preparation and execution are the two steps.

### Breakpoints
- Mixxed / Extra characters
- Data type Issues
- Case sensitivity
