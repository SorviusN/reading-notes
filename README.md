## comparison operators
  a == b - "loosely equal to" 10 == '10' - type coercion / weak typing.
  weak typing ^

  a === b - "strictly equal" to 10 === 10
  a !== b - "not equwal to (! called bang!) 10 !== '10'"
  a != b - "not loosely equal to 10 != 'banana'"
  a > b - a is greater than b
  a < b - a is less than b
  a >= b - greater than or equal to

## logical operators

&& - and a && b - both HAVE to be true.

## Arrays
  - datatype of Object.
  - a list of elements - the elements within the array can be dt
  - ['car', 1, {name: 'Sara'}] try not to have arrays with mixed elements.

## loops 

## what are they?

## Why?
- saves us from needing to repeat code.
